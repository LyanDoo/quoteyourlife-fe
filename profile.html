        <p>Hi there! I'm Lio, but you can call me Lyan. I'm a final-year Informatics Engineering student at Mercu Buana University, currently wrapping up my degree with a GPA of 3.51. </p>

        <p>My current role is as an AI developer. Throughout my career, I've developed a variety of projects, including an LLM-based Agentic Chatbot, a face-recognition attendance system, and a fingerprint attendance system for my company. These projects were successfully completed thanks to various programs I took part in, such as the Bangkit program where I certified as a Machine Learning Engineer and obtained the DCML certificate.</p>

        <p>However, my true passion lies in Data Infrastructure and Security. In my spare time, I explore this interest by installing VPN servers, turning an old Mac Mini 2012 into a server, and integrating our fingerprint attendance system with our in-house project management software. I'm also deeply interested in blue team operations, including forensics and SIEM/SOAR, and am currently focused on malware analysis.</p>

        <p>Beyond the technical stuff, I've spent almost three years as a board member of the Mercu Buana University Student Choir. This experience was incredible and helped me develop skills like communication, collaboration, and project management. I even had the chance to lead a concert committee with 16 divisions and serve as Vice President, stepping in to lead meetings and keep things running smoothly.</p>
